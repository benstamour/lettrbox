# Lettris

This repository features code for a game where the user drops letter tiles one at a time into a grid. They can choose which column to drop the tiles in, and once a word with at least 3 letters is formed from some of the tiles, they are removed from the grid. If the grid gets filled completely, the game ends. The player also has the option to bank a tile to save it for later, and they are also given a bonus word that provide a score boost when spelled.

If the player spells words that are long enough or high-scoring, they may receive special gem tiles in return that provide a score boost when used in a word. Additionally, as the game progresses, other types of tiles get introduced to the player, such as tiles that randomize their letter each turn, ones that flip the gameboard when used in a word, some that can only be used in words with at least 4 letters instead of 3, and more. In later levels, the probabilities of certain letters showing up also changes.

The game allows input from the keyboard and also provides on-screen buttons for touchscreen users, and a toggle between light mode and dark mode is provided. The code in this repository was built using Vue.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap, and the website also uses AJAX and PHP.
